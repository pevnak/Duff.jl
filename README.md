Dependency aware feature selection is a simple but effective method proposed in *Somol, Petr, Jiří Grim, and Pavel Pudil. 
"Fast dependency-aware feature selection in very-high-dimensional pattern recognition." 
2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics. IEEE, 2011.*. The method is realated to Shapley values 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value) and hence to explanation methods based on this GT concept 
*Kononenko, Igor. "An efficient explanation of individual classifications using game theory." Journal of Machine Learning Research 11.Jan (2010): 1-18.*
